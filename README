This project was developed as a part of GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE '12
@author: Rabi Shanker Guha(rabisg)
Mentor: Peter Borsa(asrob)

This module provides the back-end for integrating with Identi.ca.
It uses Abraham Williams' Twitter OAuth library
(https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth) at its backend.
and is heavily inspired from Twitter module.
For use cases refer to
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Insight_use_cases_for_status_and_microblogging

HOW TO USE THIS MODULE

1. First register your ap on http://identi.ca/settings/oauthapps/new
and provide OAuth Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.
(leave the other field blank for now)

2. On enabling this module it adds a Identica fieldset to user
profile form(user/%user/edit). Click on 'Add an Account' to grant
access to your Identi.ca account. Now your Identi.ca account is
linked to your Drupal account and other modules can use it to post
messages, etc.

The Use Cases also specify that users should be able to post to Identi.ca
directly through this website. While the implementation for it is in a
different module (insight_status) this module provides the helper function
for posting to Identi.ca as Fedora
And the "Fedora's Identi.ca Account" textbox on the config page expects
the Drupal username of the user from whose account Fedora's account on
Identi.ca is linked

The following steps enumerate how to configure it:
a. Login to Identi.ca as Fedora.
b. Log in to any Drupal account on Insight (lets say rabisg).
c. Go to profile/edit and click on "Add an Account" under Identi.ca.
d. Grant permission(as Fedora). Now you would see Fedora's account linked
   in rabisg's Drupal account.
e. Now type in the username(rabisg in this case) into
   "Fedora's Identi.ca Account" textbox on the config page(admin/config/services/identica).

Feel free to post your suggestions/feedback.
Bugs related to Twitter library should be posted there.
